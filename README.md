# Brewery Station
This is a small simple web app to monitor your winemaker game, rest your vintners, and claim $VINTAGE.

This app is hosted on the Interplanetary Filesystem (IPFS), you can access the app anywhere, anytime at the following URLs:

and if you can access IPFS directly:

I personally use this interface for claims and resting, additonal features might be added; If you see me on the discord (crypto_neo) and want to know if I can add a feature or not just ask, it never hurts to ask!
