Brewmaster is closed, thank you all for your support<br><br>
Why?<br>
Over 3/4 of a year basically absentee leadership in the project. No clear direction, just being told to wait for Vinium over and over and over. Repeatedly being given reasons to delay, and yet no work being done on anything to help show that GrapeFI is alive.<br><br>
Dissent is silenced rather than dealt with responsibly and that pisses me off<br> The one thing that drew me into this project even throughout a bear market was LB never seemed to stop building and trying new ideas, and I did (and still do) admire that. But I don't feel like he's here for the project anymore, supposedly he's promoting Grape/Vinium at the avalanche stuff; yet for all intents and purposes it feels like a mother telling their child that dad just went out for milk and cigarettes and will be back any minutes.<br><br>
I'm a very patient person, I make W40K space marines look like petulent toddlers, but even my patience has limits, <br><br>
TLDR, I lost faith in the project and this is my silent protest. All the grapefi stuff still works fine, but Brewmaster will no longer be provided.<br>
<h3>So long, and thanks for all the fish!</h3>
